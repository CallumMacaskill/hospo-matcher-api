# Project Description
Choosing a cafe, restaurant, or bar to go to when meeting up with friends can be tricky!

Let's change this process from a couple of suggestions and "up to you" messages, to a fun, gamified, collaborative experience.

You and your friends can find which venues you all like, tailored to your specific preferences through a 'swipe and match' style UI with a frictionless user flow.

# Repository Description
This repository contains the API that handles interactions with app sessions and interfaces with the database.

Readme is a WIP
