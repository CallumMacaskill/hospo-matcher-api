# Hospo Matcher API
The original plan for this product was to implement it as a web app with extensive features and a high-fidelity UI/UX. During development, the plan changed to target a single, main feature and for it to be implemented as a plain JS website. 

The finished product is in another repository - [Midpoint](https://github.com/CallumMacaskill/midpoint).

This repository exists as a good example of an asynchronous FastAPI project featuring an extensive test suite with mock data and dependency overrides.
